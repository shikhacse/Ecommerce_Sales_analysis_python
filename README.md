---

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on an E-commerce sales dataset.  
The primary goal is to **understand customer and sales behavior**, uncover patterns across different product categories and customer segments, and generate **business insights** that can help optimize marketing and sales strategies.

---

## ðŸ”Ž Key Objectives

- Analyze how sales vary across product categories and customer segments.
- Investigate the impact of price, discount, and marketing spend on sales performance.
- Identify patterns, trends, and opportunities for business improvement.

## ðŸ“ˆ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Insights

| Chart | Insight |
|:---|:---|
| **Correlation Matrix** | Very weak or no correlation between Price, Discount, Marketing Spend, and Units Sold. |
| **Sales Distribution by Product Category** | Electronics and Sports have slightly higher total sales, but overall sales are fairly balanced across categories. |
| **Price Distribution** | Product prices are spread between $0 and $1000 with no major skewness. |
| **Discount Distribution** | Discounts vary widely, with most between 20%â€“40%. |
| **Sales by Customer Segment** | Occasional and Regular customers drive most of the sales compared to Premium customers. |
| **Marketing Spend vs Units Sold** | No clear trend; higher marketing spend does not necessarily result in higher units sold. |
| **Sales Trends Over Time** | Sales fluctuate significantly over time without strong seasonality patterns. |
| **Sales Distribution by Product Category and Customer Segment** | Sales are fairly evenly spread across customer segments within each category. |
| **Boxplot of Price by Product Category** | Wide range of prices across all product categories; no category is strictly expensive or cheap. |
| **Pairplot of Numerical Features** | No strong linear relationships among numerical features. |
| **Distribution of Marketing Spend by Customer Segment** | Marketing spend is similar across all customer segments. |
| **Units Sold Over Time by Product Category** | Sales trends for all categories are volatile, with no single category dominating over time. |
| **Discount Distribution by Product Category** | Toys and Fashion tend to offer slightly higher discounts compared to other categories. |
